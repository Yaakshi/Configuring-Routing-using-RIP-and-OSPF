## Recreating the network

### Additional modules for the routers

We need to use Serial DCE cables to connect between two routers. But by default, the routers do not have modules with serial ports. Hence, we need to add the HWIC-2T Interface card. It provides 2 serial ports.

Click on each of the routers.

Go to Physical → Switch off the router → Add the module in either slot 0 or slot 1 → Switch on the router

### Cables

- Endpoints and switches – Copper straight through
- Switches and router – Copper cross over
- Routers – Serial DCE
